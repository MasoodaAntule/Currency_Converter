# Currency_Converter
The currency converter web app is designed to facilitate the conversion of amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates. It allows users to input an amount in one currency and obtain the equivalent in another currency. By integrating with an external API, the app retrieves up-to-date exchange rates, which are then stored in a MySQL database for efficient future access. This ensures accurate and swift currency conversions. The application features a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process, making it easy for users to quickly and reliably convert currencies as needed.
